The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a classification model that can accurately identify the species of iris flowers based on their measurements. The model aims to automate the classification process, offering a practical solution for identifying iris species.
The project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that contains iris flower measurements associated with their respective species.
The trained model will classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.
